## About Myself
As a child, when I was 10, I started programming in BASIC. It was fun. At school I really liked computer science and programming. After school, I went to university and graduated as an electrical engineer. But the childhood love of programming has not gone away.

Now I want to learn the necessary knowledge and become a front-end developer.
